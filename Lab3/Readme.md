   # Software:
   
   # The roles of application, utility and operating system softwarea and example of each.
   Two subcategories of application software worth mentioning are utility software and programming software. Utility software includes software that allows you to fix or modify your computer in some way. Examples include antivirus software and disk defragmentation software. These types of software packages were invented to fill shortcomings in operating systems. Many times, a subsequent release of an operating system will include these utility functions as part of the operating system itself.
Programming software is software whose purpose is to make more software. Most of these programs provide programmers with an environment in which they can write the code, test it, and convert it into the format that can then be run on a computer. 

# The purpose of ERP software and provide an example.
ERP was developed to bring together an entire organization in one software application.

“A software application”: An ERP is a software application that is used by many of an organization’s employees.
“utilizing a central database”: All users of the ERP edit and save their information from the data source. What this means practically is that there is only one customer database, there is only one calculation for revenue, etc.
“that is implemented throughout the entire organization”: ERP systems include functionality that covers all of the essential components of a business. Further, an organization can purchase modules for its ERP system that match specific needs, such as manufacturing or planning. 

# The purpose of virtualization and describe how it differs from cloud computing. 

 Virtualization relies on software to simulate hardware functionality and create a virtual computer system. This enables IT organizations to run more than one virtual system – and multiple operating systems and applications – on a single server. The resulting benefits include economies of scale and greater efficiency.
 
 Virtualization vs. Cloud Computing:
 
Although equally buzz-worthy technologies, virtualization and cloud computing are not interchangeable. Virtualization is software that makes computing environments independent of physical infrastructure, while cloud computing is a service that delivers shared computing resources (software and/or data) on demand via the Internet. As complementary solutions, organizations can begin by virtualizing their servers and then moving to cloud computing for even greater agility and self-service.

  # The term software; 
Software is the set of instructions that tell the hardware what to do.

# Two primary categories of software; 
Software can be broadly divided into two categories: operating systems and application software. Operating systems manage the hardware and create the interface between the hardware and the user. Application software is the category of programs that do something useful for the user.

# The role ERP software plays in an organization;
The enterprise resource planning (ERP) system (sometimes just called enterprise software) was developed to bring together an entire organization in one software application. Simply put, an ERP system is a software application utilizing a central database that is implemented throughout the entire organization.

# Cloud computing and its advantages and disadvantages for use in an organization
# Advantages of Cloud Computing:
No software to install or upgrades to maintain.
Available from any computer that has access to the Internet.
Can scale to a large number of users easily.
New applications can be up and running very quickly.
Services can be leased for a limited time on an as-needed basis.
Your information is not lost if your hard disk crashes or your laptop is stolen.
You are not limited by the available memory or disk space on your computer

# Disadvantages of Cloud Computing:
Your information is stored on someone else’s computer – how safe is it?
You must have Internet access to use it. If you do not have access, you’re out of luck.
You are relying on a third-party to provide these services.

# The term open-source and identify its primary characteristics.

   Open-source software is software that makes the source code available for anyone to copy and use.
   
The open-source movement has led to the development of some of the most-used software in the world, including the Firefox browser, the Linux operating system, and the Apache web server. Many also think open-source software is superior to closed-source software. Because the source code is freely available, many programmers have contributed to open-source software projects, adding features and fixing bugs.
 


  # Virtualization 

# What types of problems are solved with virtualization? 
Data virtualization.
Desktop virtualization.
Server virtualization.
Operating system virtualization.
Network functions virtualization
 

# What role does hypervisor play in virtualization? 
 hypervisors separate the physical resources from the virtual environments—the things that need those resources. Hypervisors can sit on top of an operating system (like on a laptop) or be installed directly onto hardware (like a server), which is how most enterprises virtualize. Hypervisors take your physical resources and divide them up so that virtual environments can use them.
 




# Introduction to Python 

# What is meant by the "pseudo-code nature of Python?" (Google "pseudo-code" to gain better insight) 
 This pseudo-code nature of Python is one of its greatest strengths. It allows you to concentrate on the solution to the problem rather than the language itself.

# What is an interpreted language vs. a compiled language?

A compiled language is one where the program, once compiled, is expressed in the instructions of the target machine.

An interpreted language is one where the instructions are not directly executed by the target machine, but instead read and executed by some other program (which normally is written in the language of the native machine.
